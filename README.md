# MotorMind | Predictor-PSOE
This platform leverages an Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-based methodology to accurately quantify and correct Position Sensor Offset Error (PSOE) in Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machines (PMSMs). By analyzing motor parameters such as current, speed, voltage, and the number of poles, the platform ensures precise predictions and real-time insights, enabling enhanced motor performance, reduced downtime, and optimized system efficiency for developers and engineers.
